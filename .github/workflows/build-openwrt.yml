name: Build OpenWRT Images for Multiple Devices
# 
# This workflow builds OpenWRT images for multiple router devices.
# It includes automatic hash updates to handle frequently changing OpenWRT packages.
# Hash mismatches are handled gracefully with fallback build strategies.

            ## Supported Devices

            - **BananaPi BPI-R4-8G**: MediaTek Filogic MT7988A, 8GB RAM, WiFi 7 BPI-R4-NIC-BE14 (IP: 192.168.1.1)
              ⚠️ **Important**: BL2 bootloader update required for 8GB RAM recognition
            - **Xiaomi Mi WiFi R3G v1**: MediaTek MT7621 (IP: 192.168.2.1)

            ## Installation

            1. Download the appropriate image file for your device
            2. Flash using bootloader, web interface, or sysupgrade
            3. SSH access with your configured key (no password login)

            ## File Types

            - `*-sysupgrade.bin`: For upgrading existing OpenWRT installations
            - `*-factory.bin`: For fresh installations
            - `device-info.txt`: Build information for each device
